# [USACO23OPEN] Triples of Cows P
## 题目描述

There are initially $N-1$ pairs of friends among FJ's $N$ cows labeled $1\dots N$, forming a tree. The cows are
leaving the farm for vacation one by one. On day $i$, the $i$ th cow leaves the
farm, and then all pairs of the $i$ th cow's friends still present on the farm
become friends. 

For each $i$ from $1$ to $N$, just before the $i$ th cow leaves,  how many
ordered triples of distinct cows $(a,b,c)$ are there such that none of $a,b,c$
are on vacation, $a$ is friends with $b$, and $b$ is friends with $c$?
## 输入格式

The first line contains $N$.

The next $N-1$ lines contain two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ denoting that cows
$u_i$ and $v_i$ are initially friends.
## 输出格式

The answers for $i$ from $1$ to $N$ on separate lines.

## 提示

For the first sample:  
$(1,2,3)$ and $(3,2,1)$ are the triples just before cow $1$ leaves.  
After cow
$1$ leaves, there are less than $3$ cows left, so no triples are possible.

For the second sample:  
At the beginning, cow $1$ is friends with all other cows, and no other pairs of
cows are friends, so the triples are $(a, 1, c)$ where $a, c$ are different cows
from $\{2, 3, 4\}$, which gives $3 \cdot 2 = 6$ triples.  
After cow $1$ leaves, the remaining three cows are all friends, so the triples
are just those three cows in any of the $3! = 6$ possible orders.  
After cow $2$ leaves, there are less than $3$ cows left, so no triples are
possible.  

$2\le N\le 2\cdot 10^5$, $1\le u_i,v_i\le N$.

- Inputs 4-5: $N\le 500$.
- Inputs 6-10: $N\le 5000$.
- Inputs 11-20: No additional constraints.

给定一棵初始有 $n$ 个点的树。

在第 $i$ 天，这棵树的第 $i$ 个点会被删除，所有与点 $i$ **直接相连**的点之间都会**两两**连上一条边。你需要在每次删点**发生前**，求出满足 $(a,b)$ 之间有边，$(b,c)$ 之间有边且 $a\not=c$的**有序**三元组 $(a,b,c)$ 对数。
