# [NEERC2014] Joke with permutation
## 题目描述

Joey had saved a permutation of integers from $1$ to $n$ in a text file. All the numbers were written as decimal numbers without leading spaces.

Then Joe made a practical joke on her: he removed all the spaces in the file.

Help Joey to restore the original permutation after the Joe's joke! 
## 输入格式

The input file contains a single line with a single string -- the Joey's permutation without spaces.

The Joey's permutation had at least $1$ and at most $50$ numbers. 
## 输出格式

Write a line to the output file with the restored permutation. Don’t forget the spaces!

If there are several possible original permutations, write any one of them.

## 题目翻译

给出数字之间无分隔符的 $1\dots n$ 的排列构成的字符串，将其还原为合法的排列。

保证 $n\leq 50$，输入数据均保证有解。如有多解输出任一即可。
