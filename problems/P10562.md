# [ICPC2024 Xi'an I] Triangle
## 题目描述

There are three points $A(a, 0)$, $B(0, b)$, $C(0, 0)$ in the plane rectangular coordinate system. Define the size of triangle $ABC$ as the number of squares that belong to it.
    
    
    
For integers $x,y$, one square is defined by four points $(x, y)$, $(x + 1, y)$, $(x, y + 1)$, $(x + 1, y + 1)$. We consider a square to belong to a triangle if half or more of it is inside the triangle.
    
    
    
For example, when $a = 8, b = 6$, the size of triangle $ABC$ will be $24$. The image below shows which squares are counted in the triangle.
