## 题目描述

You are trying to schedule a special event on one of five possible days.

Your job is to determine on which day you should schedule the event, so that the largest number of interested people are able to attend.
## 输入格式

The first line of input will contain a positive integer $N$, representing the number of people interested in attending your event. The next $N$ lines will each contain one person's availability using one character for each of Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Day 4, and Day 5(in that order).

The character `Y` means the person is able to attend and a period (`.`) means the person is
not able to attend.

The following table shows how the available 15 marks are distributed:
| Marks | Description |
| :----------: | :----------: |
| 6 | There will be exactly one day on which every person will be able to attend. |
| 6 | There will be exactly one day on which the largest number of people will be able to attend. |
| 3 | There might be more than one day on which the largest number of people will be able to attend. |
