# [COI2007] Policija
## 题目描述

To help capture criminals on the run, the police are introducing a new computer system. The area covered by the police contains N cities and E bidirectional roads connecting them. The cities are labelled 1 to N.

为了帮助抓捕逃犯，警方引进了一套新的电脑系统。警察的辖区包含 $N$ 座城市和 $E$ 条双向道路，城市的编号是 $1\sim N$。

The police often want to catch criminals trying to get from one city to another. Inspectors, looking at a map, try to determine where to set up barricades and roadblocks. The new computer system should answer the following two types of queries:

警察常常要抓住那些逃往另一个城市的罪犯。侦查员看着地图，试着确定在哪里设置路障。新的计算机系统要回答以下两种问题：

1. Consider two cities A and B, and a road connecting cities G1 and G2. Can the criminals get
from city A to city B if that one road is blocked and the criminals can't use it?

考虑城市 $A$ 和 $B$，以及连接城市 $G_1$ 和 $G_2$ 的道路。罪犯能否在那条路不通的情况下从 $A$ 逃到 $B$？

2. Consider three cities A, B and C. Can the criminals get from city A to city B if the entire city C is cut off and the criminals can't enter that city?

考虑三个城市 $A, B, C$。罪犯能否在无法通过 $C$ 的情况下从 $A$ 逃到 $B$?

Write a program that implements the described system.

写一个程序实现上述系统。
## 输入格式

The first line contains two integers N and E (2 ≤ N ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ E ≤ 500 000), the number of cities and roads.

第一行两个整数 $N, E$（$2\leq N\leq 10 ^ 5$，$1\leq E\leq 5\times 10 ^ 5$），表示城市数量和道路数量。

Each of the following E lines contains two distinct integers between 1 and N – the labels of two cities connected by a road. There will be at most one road between any pair of cities.

接下来 $E$ 行，每行两个不同的数字 $u, v$，表示编号为 $u, v$ 的城市之间有一条道路。一对城市之间最多只有一条道路。

The following line contains the integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 300 000), the number of queries the system is being tested on.

接下来一行，一个整数 $Q$（$1\leq Q\leq 3\times 10 ^ 5$），表示询问数量。

Each of the following Q lines contains either four or five integers. The first of these integers is the type of the query – 1 or 2.

接下来 $Q$ 行，每行四或五个整数描述一组询问。第一个数表示询问的类型 —— $1$ 或 $2$。

If the query is of type 1, then the same line contains four more integers A, B, G1 and G2 as described earlier. A and B will be different. G1 and G2 will represent an existing road.

如果询问类型为 $1$，那么在同一行还有四个整数 $A, B, G_1, G_2$。$A, B$ 不同，且 $G_1, G_2$ 之间存在道路。

If the query is of type 2, then the same line contains three more integers A, B and C. A, B and C will be distinct integers.

如果询问类型为 $2$，那么在同一行还有三个整数 $A, B, C$。$A, B, C$ 两两不同。

The test data will be such that it is initially possible to get from each city to every other city.

保证图中每两个点相互连通。
## 输出格式

Output the answers to all Q queries, one per line. The answer to a query can be "yes" or "no".

对于每组询问，输出 `yes` 或 `no` 表示回答。
