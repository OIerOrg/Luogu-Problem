# [USACO03Open] Lost Cows
## 题目描述

N (2 <= N <= 8,000) cows have unique brands in the range 1..N. In a spectacular display of poor judgment, they visited the neighborhood 'watering hole' and drank a few too many beers before dinner. When it was time to line up for their evening meal, they did not line up in the required ascending numerical order of their brands.Regrettably, FJ does not have a way to sort them. 

Furthermore, he's not very good at observing problems. Instead of writing down each cow's brand, he determined a rather silly statistic: For each cow in line, he knows the number of cows that precede that cow in line that do, in fact, have smaller brands than that cow.Given this data, tell FJ the exact ordering of the cows.
## 输入格式

Line 1: A single integer, N

Lines 2..N: These N-1 lines describe the number of cows that precede a given cow in line and have brands smaller than that cow. Of course, no cows precede the first cow in line, so she is not listed. Line 2 of the input describes the number of preceding cows whose brands are smaller than the cow in slot #2; line 3 describes the number of preceding cows whose brands are smaller than the cow in slot #3; and so on.
## 输出格式

Lines 1..N: Each of the N lines of output tells the brand of a cow in line. Line #1 of the output tells the brand of the first cow in line; line 2 tells the brand of the second cow; and so on.

### 题目描述

有 $N$ 头奶牛，已知它们的编号为 $1∼N$ 且各不相同，但不知道每头奶牛的具体编号。

现在这 $N$ 头奶牛站成一列，已知第 $i$ 头奶牛前面有 $a_i$ 头牛编号小于它，求每头奶牛的编号。

### 输入格式

第 $1$ 行，输入一个整数 $N$

第 $2...N$ 行，每行输入一个整数 $a_i$，表示第 $i$ 头奶牛前面有 $a_i$ 头奶牛的编号小于它（因为第一头奶牛前面没有奶牛，所以 $i$ 从 $2$ 开始）。

### 输出格式

输出包含 $N$ 行，每行输出一个整数表示奶牛的编号。

第 $i$ 行输出第 $i$ 头奶牛的编号。

### 数据范围

$2 \le N \le 8000$。
