Hint: he example input is coresponding to this graph. And from the graph, you can se that the computer 4 is farthest one from 1, so S1 =3. Computer 4 and 5 are the farthest ones from 2, so S2=2. Computer 5 is the farthest one from3.so S3=3. We also get S4=4，S5-4.

## 输入格式

Input file contains multiple test cases.in each case there is natural number N (N<=1000) in the first line, folowed by (N-1) lines with descriptions of computers. ithline contains two natural numbers - number of computer.to which i-th computer is conected and leneth ofcable used for connection. "otaleneth of cable doe notexceed 10^9. Numbers in lines ofinput are separated by a space.

## 输出格式

For each case output N lines. i-th line must contain number Si for i-th computer (1<-i<=N)
