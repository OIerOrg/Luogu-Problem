# [USACO16OPEN] 248 G
## 题目描述

Bessie likes downloading games to play on her cell phone, even though she  doesfind the small touch screen rather cumbersome to use with her large hooves.

She is particularly intrigued by the current game she is playing.The game starts with a sequence of $N$ positive integers ($2 \leq N\leq 248$), each in the range $1 \ldots 40$.  In one move, Bessie cantake two adjacent numbers with equal values and replace them a singlenumber of value one greater (e.g., she might replace two adjacent 7swith an 8).  The goal is to maximize the value of the largest numberpresent in the sequence at the end of the game.  Please help Bessiescore as highly as possible!

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains $N$, and the next $N$ lines give the sequence

of $N$ numbers at the start of the game.

## 输出格式

Please output the largest integer Bessie can generate.

## 提示

In this example shown here, Bessie first merges the second and third 1s to

obtain the sequence 1 2 2, and then she merges the 2s into a 3.  Note that it is

not optimal  to join the first two 1s.

## 题目翻译

给定一个 $1\times n\,(2\le n\le248)$ 的地图，在里面玩 2048，每次可以合并两个相邻且相同的数（数值范围 $1\sim 40$），问序列中出现的最大数字的值最大是多少。注意合并后的数值并非加倍而是 $+1$，例如 $2$ 与 $2$ 合并后的数值为 $3$。
