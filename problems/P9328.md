# [CCC 2023 S5] The Filter
## 题目描述

Alice, the mathematician, likes to study real numbers that are between $0$ and $1$. Her favourite tool is the filter.

A filter covers part of the number line. When a number reaches a filter, two events can happen. If a number is not covered by the filter, the number will pass through. If a number is covered, the number will be removed.

Alice has infinitely many filters. Her first $3$ filters look like this:

In general, the $k\text{-th}$ filter can be defined as follows:

- Consider the number line from $0$ to $1$.

- Split this number line into $3^k$ equal-sized pieces. There are $3^k + 1$ points and $3^k$ intervals.

- The $k\text{-th}$ filter consists of the $2^{\text{nd}}$ interval, $5^{\text{th}}$ interval, $8^{\text{th}}$ interval, and in general, the $(3i-1)^{\text{th}}$ interval. The points are **not** part of the $k\text{-th}$ filter.

Alice has instructions for constructing the Cantor set. Start with the number line from $0$ to $1$. Apply all filters on the number line, and remove the numbers that are covered. The remaining numbers form the Cantor set.

Alice wants to research the Cantor set, and she came to you for help. Given an integer $N$, Alice would like to know which fractions $\frac{x}{N}$ are in the Cantor set.
## 输入格式

The first line contains the integer $N$.

The following table shows how the available $15$ marks are distributed.

| Marks | Bounds on $N$ | Additional Constraints |
| :----------: | :----------: | :----------: |
| $3$ marks | $3 \leq N \leq 3^{18}$ | $N$ is a power of $3$. |
| $4$ marks | $2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^5$ | None. |
| $8$ marks | $2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^9$ | None. |

## 输出格式

Output all integers $x$ where $0 \leq x \leq N$ and $\frac{x}{N}$ is in the Cantor set.

Output the answers in increasing order. The number of answers will not exceed $10^6$.

## 提示

![](https://cdn.luogu.com.cn/upload/image_hosting/jy3xb2rz.png)

$\frac{5}{12},\frac{6}{12},\frac{7}{12}$ are not in the Cantor set because they were covered by the 1st filter.
Furthermore, $\frac{2}{12}$ and $\frac{10}{12}$
are not in the Cantor set because they were covered by the $2^{\text{nd}}$ filter.

It can be shown that the remaining fractions will pass through all filters.

**本题采用捆绑测试**：

- Subtask 1（3 points）：$3 \leq N \leq 3 ^{18}$，$N$ 是 $3$ 的整数次幂。

- Subtask 2（4 points）：$2 \leq N \leq 2\times 10^5$。

- Subtask 3（8 points）：$2 \leq N \leq 2 \times 10^9$。
## 题目翻译

Alice 有无穷个筛子，筛子从 $1$ 开始标号。第 $k$ 个筛子作用如下：

- 考虑数轴上大于等于 $0$ 小于等于 $1$ 部分。
- 将这部分均分为 $3^k$ 个同样长的段。此时将获得 $3^k+1$ 个端点和 $3^k$ 个段。
- 筛子将筛除形如第 $2,5,8,(3 \times i-1)$ 个段。注意，端点不会被筛去。

给定正整数 $N(1\leq N \leq 2 \times 10^9)$，你需要从小到大输出所有的 $x(0\leq x \leq N)$，满足 $\frac x N$ 没有被筛去。

保证合法的 $x$ 的数量小于等于 $10^6$ 个。
