# Tree
## 题目描述

Give a tree with n vertices,each edge has a length(positive integer less than 1001).

Define dist(u,v)=The min distance between node u and v.

Give an integer k,for every pair (u,v) of vertices is called valid if and only if dist(u,v) not exceed k.

Write a program that will count how many pairs which are valid for a given tree.
## 输入格式

The input contains several test cases. The first line of each test case contains two integers n, k. (n<=10000) The following n-1 lines each contains three integers u,v,l, which means there is an edge between node u and v of length l.
The last test case is followed by two zeros.
## 输出格式

For each test case output the answer on a single line.
