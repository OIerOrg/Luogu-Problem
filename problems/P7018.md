# [CERC2013] Bus
## 题目描述

A bus with $n$ passengers opens its door at the bus stop. Exactly half of its passengers and an additional half of a passenger get out. On the next stop, again, half of the passengers plus half of a passenger leave the bus. This goes on for $k$ stops in total. Knowing that the bus leaves the last stop empty, and that no one was hurt during the trip, determine the initial number $n$ of people in the bus.
## 输入格式

The first line of input contains the number of test cases $T$. The descriptions of the test cases follow:

The only line of each test case contains the number of stops $k$, $1 \leq k \leq 30$.
## 输出格式

For each test case, output a single line containing a single integer—the initial number of bus passengers.

# [CERC2013] Bus

## 题面翻译

有一个数 $n$ ，定义一次操作为使 $n\rightarrow \frac{n-1}{2}$ 。已知经过了 $k$ 次操作后 $n$ 恰好为 $0$，求 $n$。
 
多测，有 $T$ 组数据，$T$ 在输入数据开头给出。 

保证 $1\leqslant k\leqslant 30$。
