# [USACO10FEB] Chocolate Buying S
## 题目描述

Bessie and the herd love chocolate so Farmer John is buying them some.

The Bovine Chocolate Store features $N (1 \le N \le 100,000)$ kinds of chocolate in essentially unlimited quantities.  Each type i of chocolate has price $P_i (1 \le P_i \le 10^{18})$ per piece and there are $C_i (1 \le C_i \le 10^{18})$ cows that want that type of chocolate.

Farmer John has a budget of $B (1 \le B \le 10^{18})$ that he can spend on chocolates for the cows. What is the maximum number of cows that he can satisfy?  All cows only want one type of chocolate, and will be satisfied only by that type.

Consider an example where FJ has $50$ to spend on $5$ different types of chocolate. A total of eleven cows have various chocolate preferences:

|Chocolate\_Type|Per\_Chocolate\_Cost|Cows\_preferring\_this\_type| 
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
|$1$|$5$|$3$|
|$2$|$1$|$1$|
|$3$|$10$|$4$|
|$4$|$7$|$2$|
|$5$|$60$|$1$|

Obviously, FJ can't purchase chocolate type $5$, since he doesn't have enough money. Even if it cost only $50$, it's a counterproductive purchase since only one cow would be satisfied.

Looking at the chocolates start at the less expensive ones, he can purchase $1$ chocolate of type $2$ for $1 \times 1$ leaving $50-1=49$, then purchase $3$ chocolate of type $1$ for $3 \times 5$ leaving $49-15=34$, then  purchase $2$ chocolate of type $4$ for $2 \times 7$ leaving $34-14=20$, then  purchase $2$ chocolate of type $3$ for $2 \times 10$ leaving $20-20=0$.

He would thus satisfy $1 + 3 + 2 + 2 = 8$ cows.

贝茜和其他奶牛们都喜欢巧克力，所以约翰准备买一些送给她们。奶牛巧克力专卖店里有 $N$ 种巧克力，每种巧克力的数量都是无限多的。

每头奶牛只喜欢一种巧克力，调查显示，有 $C_i$ 头奶牛喜欢第 $i$ 种巧克力，这种巧克力的售价是 $P_i$。

约翰手上有 $B$ 元预算，怎样用这些钱让尽量多的奶牛高兴呢？
