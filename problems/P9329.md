# [JOISC 2023 Day1] Two Currencies
## 题目描述

There are $N$ cities in JOI Kingdom, numbered from $1$ to $N$. There are $N - 1$ roads in JOI Kingdom, numbered from $1$ to $N - 1$. The road $i \ (1 \le i \le N - 1)$ connects the city $A_i$ and the city $B_i$ bi-directionally. It is possible to travel from any city to any other city by passing through some of the roads.

There are checkpoints on some of the roads in JOI Kingdom. There are $M$ checkpoints, numbered from $1$ to $M$. The checkpoint $j \ (1 \le j \le M)$ is located on the road $P_j$. In order to pass through it, you need to pay either one gold coin or $C_j$ silver coins.

There are $Q$ citizens in JOI Kingdom, numbered from $1$ to $Q$. The citizen $k \ (1 \le k \le Q)$ has $X_k$ gold coins and $Y_k$ silver coins, and wants to travel from the city $S_k$ to the city $T_k$. Since gold coins are valuable, all the citizens want to keep as many gold coins as possible.

Write a program which, given information of the cities, the roads, the checkpoints, and the citizens in JOI Kingdom, for each $k \ (1 \le k \le Q)$, determines whether it is possible for the citizen $k$ to travel from the city $S_k$ to the city $T_k$, and, if it is possible, calculates the maximum possible number of gold coins the citizen $k$ can keep.
## 输入格式

Read the following data from the standard input.

## 输出格式

Write $Q$ lines to the standard output. In the $k$-th line $(1 \le k \le Q)$, if the citizen $k$ can travel from the city $S_k$ to the city $T_k$, output the maximum possible number of gold coins the citizen $k$ can keep. Otherwise, output $-1$ in the $k$-th line.

## 提示

**【样例解释 #1】**

The citizen $1$ can travel from the city $3$ to the city $4$ as follows. After the travel, the citizen $1$ keeps one gold coin.

1.  The citizen $1$ travels from the city $3$ to the city $1$ by passing through the road $2$. There are the checkpoints $1, 2$ on the road $2$. The citizen $1$ pays one gold coin at the checkpoint $1$ and passes through it, and $4$ silver coins at the checkpoint $2$ and passes through it, respectively. After that, the citizen $1$ keeps one gold coin and $7$ silver coins.
2. The citizen $1$ travels from the city $1$ to the city $2$ by passing through the road $1$. Since there is no checkpoint on the road $1$, the citizen $1$ keeps one gold coin and $7$ silver coins.
3. The citizen $1$ travels from the city $2$ to the city $4$ by passing through the road $3$. There is the checkpoint $3$ on the road $3$. The citizen $1$ pays $5$ silver coins at the checkpoint $3$ and passes through it. After that, the citizen $1$ keeps one gold coin and $2$ silver coins.

Since it is impossible for the citizen $1$ to travel by finally keeping more than or equal to $2$ gold coins, output $1$ in the first line.

The citizen $2$ can travel from the city $5$ to the city $3$ as follows. After the travel, the citizen $2$ keeps two gold coins.

1. The citizen $2$ travels from the city $5$ to the city $2$ by passing through the road $4$. There is the checkpoint $4$ on the road $4$. The citizen $2$ pays one gold coin at the checkpoint $4$ and passes through it. After that, the citizen $2$ keeps $3$ gold coins and $5$ silver coins.
2. The citizen $2$ travels from the city $2$ to the city $1$ by passing through the road $1$. Since there is no checkpoint on the road $1$, the citizen $2$ keeps $3$ gold coins and $5$ silver coins.
3. The citizen $2$ travels from the city $1$ to the city $3$ by passing through the road $2$. On the road $2$, there are the checkpoints $1, 2$. The citizen $2$ pays one gold coin at the checkpoint $1$ and passes through it, and $4$ silver coins at the checkpoint $2$ and passes through it, respectively. After that, the citizen $2$ keeps $2$ gold coins and one silver coin.

Since it is impossible for the citizen $2$ to travel by finally keeping more than or equal to $3$ gold coins, output $2$ in the second line.

Since it is impossible for the citizen $3$ to travel from the city $2$ to the city $3$, output $-1$ in the third line.

## 题目翻译

#### 题目描述

在 JOI 王国中，有 $n$ 个城市，编号从 $1$ 到 $n$。JOI 王国有 $n−1$ 条双向道路，编号从 $1$ 到 $n−1$。第 $i$ 条道路连接城市 $a_i$ 和城市 $b_i$。

在 JOI 王国中，一些道路上放有检查站。有 $m$ 个检查站，编号从 $1$ 到 $m$。第 $j$ 个检查站位于道路 $p_j$ 上。通过该检查站需要支付 $1$ 枚金币或 $c_j$ 枚银币。

在 JOI 王国有 $q$ 名公民，编号从 $1$ 到 $q$。第 $k$ 名公民持有 $x_k$ 枚金币和 $y_k$ 枚银币，并希望从城市 $s_k$ 前往城市 $t_k$。由于金币具有较高的价值，所有公民都希望尽可能多地保留金币。

编写一个程序，给定 JOI 王国中的城市、道路、检查站和公民信息，对于每个 $k (1≤k≤q)$，判断公民 $k$ 是否能够从城市 $s_k$ 前往城市 $t_k$，并在此条件成立时计算公民 $k$ 所能保留的最多金币数。

#### 输入格式

从标准输入读入以下数据。
> $N \ M \ Q$
>
> $A_1 \ B_1$
>
> $A_2 \ B_2$
>
> $\vdots$
>
> $A_{N - 1} \ B_{N - 1}$
>
> $P_1 \ C_1$
>
> $P_2 \ C_2$
>
> $\vdots$
>
> $P_M \ C_M$
>
> $S_1 \ T_1 \ X_1 \ Y_1$
>
> $S_2 \ T_2 \ X_2 \ Y_2$
>
> $\vdots$
>
> $S_Q \ T_Q \ X_Q \ Y_Q$
#### 输出格式

向标准输出打印 $q$ 行。在第 $k$ 行 $(1≤k≤q)$ 中，如果公民 $k$ 可以从城市 $s_k$ 前往城市 $t_k$，请输出公民 $k$ 可以保留的最多金币数。否则，在第 $k$ 行中输出 $−1$。
